I'm excited to showcase the **Sign In** and **Sign Up** pages I've developed through **prompt engineering** with the help of **ChatGPT** and **Bing**, while attending the **Flutter Workshop** at our college (25|09|2024 - 29|09|2024).

I've shared the main files that I modified in the default Flutter project. Feel free to use them for your own projects!

### Steps to Run:

1. **Create a Default Flutter Project**
   - Open the folder where you want to create the project.
   - Copy the path of the folder.
   - Open Command Prompt (or Terminal) and change to the directory using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/folder
     ```
   - Type the following command to create a new Flutter project:
     ```bash
     flutter create projectname
     ```
   - You have successfully created a default Flutter project folder.

2. **Copy-Paste My Files**
   - Copy the modified files I've shared and paste them into the project folder you just created. Replace the existing files if prompted.

3. **Run the Project**
   - Open the project in **VS Code** or **Android Studio**.
   - Ensure you have a device connected or an emulator running.
   - Run the project using the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
