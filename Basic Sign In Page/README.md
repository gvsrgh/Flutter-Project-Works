I'm excited to showcase the **Sign In** and **Sign Up** pages I've developed through **prompt engineering** with the help of **ChatGPT** and **Bing**, while attending the **Flutter Workshop** at our college (25|09|2024 - 29|09|2024).

I've shared the main files that I modified in the default Flutter project. Feel free to use them for your own projects!
