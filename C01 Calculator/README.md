# Calculator

This project showcases a simple yet efficient calculator developed through prompt engineering with the help of ChatGPT and Bing, during the Flutter Workshop at our college (25|09|2024 - 29|09|2024).

## Steps to Run

### 1. Create a Default Flutter Project

1. Open the folder where you want to create the project.
2. Copy the path of the folder.
3. Open Command Prompt (or Terminal) and change to the directory using the `cd` command:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
4. Type the following command to create a new Flutter project:
   ```sh
   flutter create projectname
   ```
5. You have successfully created a default Flutter project folder.

### 2. Copy-Paste My Files

1. Copy the modified files I've shared (loading screen, calculator screen, and main code).
2. Paste them into the project folder you just created.
3. Replace the existing files if prompted.

### 3. Run the Project

1. Open the project in VS Code or Android Studio.
2. Ensure you have a device connected or an emulator running.
3. Start debugging to view the project or run the project using the following command in the terminal:
